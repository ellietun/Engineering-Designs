# Sheet Metal and Weldment Design

## Overview
This repository contains **SolidWorks designs** for both a **sheet metal component** and a **weldment frame**, demonstrating advanced SolidWorks techniques for manufacturing and structural applications.

## Features
- **Sheet Metal Design**: Created using the **Sheet Metal** tool in SolidWorks, including bend allowances and a flat pattern.
- **Weldment Frame**: Developed using the **Weldment** tool in SolidWorks, incorporating structural members and a cut list.
- **Technical Drawings**: Engineering blueprints for both components, featuring dimensioned views, bill of materials (BOM), and annotations.

## Files Included
- `Flat pattern - Part1W8.DWG` – DXF/DWG file for CNC or laser cutting.
- `Part1W8.pdf` – PDF document of the sheet metal technical drawing.
- `Part1W8.SLDDRW` – SolidWorks drawing file for the sheet metal component.
- `Part1W8.SLDPRT` – SolidWorks part file for the sheet metal component.
- `Weldment Frame-3.pdf` – PDF document of the weldment technical drawing.
- `Weldment Frame-3.SLDDRW` – SolidWorks drawing file for the weldment component.
- `Weldment Frame-3.SLDPRT` – SolidWorks part file for the weldment frame.

## Requirements
- **Software**: SolidWorks 2018 or later.
- **System Specs**: Recommended 16GB RAM, dedicated GPU for optimal performance.

## How to Use
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sheetmetal-weldment-design.git
   ```
2. **Open SolidWorks** and load the respective part files:
   - Use `Part1W8.SLDPRT` for the sheet metal component.
   - Use `Weldment Frame-3.SLDPRT` for the weldment frame.
3. **Review the Drawings**:
   - Open `Part1W8.SLDDRW` for the sheet metal technical drawing.
   - Open `Weldment Frame-3.SLDDRW` for the weldment technical drawing.
4. **Modify or Simulate** as needed for customization or manufacturing validation.

## Future Enhancements
- Optimize the **bend allowances** for improved manufacturability.
- Expand **weldment profiles** to include different structural standards.
- Add **stress analysis simulations** for validation.
