## Features
- **Fusion 360 3D Model**: Fully parametric worm gear system.
- **Animation**: Simulated worm and gear rotation.
- **Joint Constraints**: Properly configured revolute and rigid joints.
- **Editable Design**: Components can be modified for different configurations.

## Files Included
- `Moving Worm Gear v3.f3d` – Fusion 360 model file.
- `README.md` – Project documentation.

## Requirements
- **Software**: Autodesk Fusion 360.
- **System Specs**: Recommended 8GB RAM, dedicated GPU for rendering smooth animations.

## How to Use
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/animated-worm-gear.git
   ```
2. **Open Fusion 360** and load `Moving Worm Gear v3.f3d`.
3. **Play the Animation** to observe the gear interactions.
4. **Modify Components** as needed for customization.

## Future Improvements
- Add **more complex worm gear configurations**.
- Improve **gear meshing and efficiency**.
- Enhance **rendering and visualization** with materials and lighting.
