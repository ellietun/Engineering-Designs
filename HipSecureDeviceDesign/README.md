Description of the Design: 
The prototyped orthopaedic device aims to tackle an important issue in treating hip fractures in osteoporotic bone patients. As mentioned in the initial need statement, the device's essential purpose is to enhance the holding capacity of the lag screw in the fracture device so that it mitigates screw pull-out and decreases the need for further major surgeries. For this reason, the implemented mechanism centres on an expandable pedicle screw system designed to replace the traditional lag screw used in sliding compression hip screw systems. This enhancement aims to significantly improve the stability of internal fixation in the hip, particularly in the fragile femoral neck region affected by osteoporosis.
