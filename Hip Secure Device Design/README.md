# HipSecure Device Design 

## Description of the Design
The prototyped orthopaedic device aims to tackle an important issue in treating hip fractures in osteoporotic bone patients. As mentioned in the initial need statement, the device's essential purpose is to enhance the holding capacity of the lag screw in the fracture device so that it mitigates screw pull-out and decreases the need for further major surgeries. For this reason, the implemented mechanism centres on an expandable pedicle screw system designed to replace the traditional lag screw used in sliding compression hip screw systems. This enhancement aims to significantly improve the stability of internal fixation in the hip, particularly in the fragile femoral neck region affected by osteoporosis.

## Design Features 
### Feature 1:Expandable Screw Mechanism
The core innovation in this prototyped design is the expandable screw feature, which increases in diameter once conveyed inside the bone. This development mitigates the screw pulling out from osteoporotic bones, which is a common problem with standard screws due to poor bone quality. 
### Feature 2:Adjustable Expansion Angles
Unique to this design is the capacity to alter the expansion angles of the screw inserted. The screw is designed so that it is adaptable to various degrees based on the bone density and porosity of the patient. This feature ultimately allows for customized stabilization tailored to the individualâ€™s bone condition, potentially reducing the need for future major corrective surgeries.  
### Feature 3:Multiple Faces of Expansion
The expandable screw is specifically designed with four expansion faces. This design ensures that the screw can uniformly distribute stress and increase its grip within the osteoporotic bone, providing robust anchorage and minimizing internal movement. The four-faced design optimizes contact with the internal bone structure, enhancing stability and security. Figure 3 below shows a visual representation on the multiple faces that the screw possesses.
